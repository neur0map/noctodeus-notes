# TODO

## Current Stack (can build now with what we have)

* [ ] Version history / file recovery (automatic snapshots, restore previous versions)
* [ ] Quick capture (global hotkey to capture a thought without opening the full app)
* [ ] Queryable database views (filter, sort, group notes by metadata — table/kanban/calendar)
* [ ] Task management across vault (inline tasks with due dates, filtered/queried, kanban view)

## Needs 3rd Party Libraries or Plugins

* [ ] Canvas / infinite whiteboard (tldraw or excalidraw integration)
* [ ] Spaced repetition / flashcards (SM-2 algorithm, review scheduler)
* [ ] Web clipper (browser extension to capture pages/highlights into vault)
* [ ] Excalidraw / visual sketching (embedded hand-drawn diagrams)
* [x] AI integration — context-aware (semantic search, summarize, Q&A across vault)
* [ ] Sync across devices (E2E encrypted, conflict resolution)
* [ ] Spellcheck (research proper implementation for Tauri/WKWebView)

## Needs Custom Architecture / Major Engineering

* [ ] Block-level references & embeds (stable block IDs, transclusion, live propagation)
* [ ] Plugin / extension API (sandboxed API for community extensions)
* [ ] Publish / digital garden (select notes → public website)
* [ ] Real-time collaboration (CRDT-based multiplayer editing)
* [ ] Formulas / computed properties (expression evaluator for metadata fields)
